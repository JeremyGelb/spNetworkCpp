Description: The spNetwork package provides functions to perform spatial analysis on network.
    To increase calculation speed, some algorithms have been written with Rcpp. Currently, it is
    not possible to easily call a Rcpp function in a multicore context. The only workaround is 
    to put the Rcpp functions in a separate package, and to directly load this package in each 
    separate R instance. Thus, the spNetworkCpp contains the Rcpp functions used in the
    spNetwork package.
