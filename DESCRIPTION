Description: The spNetwork packages provides functions to perform spatial analysis on network.
    To increase calculation speed, some algorithms have been written with Rcpp. Actually, it is
    not possible to call easily a Rcpp function in a multicore context. The only workarround is 
    to put the Rcpp functions in a separate package, and to directly load this package in each 
    separate R instances. Thus, the spNetworkCpp contains the Rcpp functions used in the package
    spNetwork.
